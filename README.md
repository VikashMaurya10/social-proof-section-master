### What I learned

By taking this task I understand how to create star-rating design.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.star-rating {
  &::before {
    content: url("../assets/images/icon-star.svg") "     "
      url("../assets/images/icon-star.svg") "     "
      url("../assets/images/icon-star.svg") "     "
      url("../assets/images/icon-star.svg") "     "
      url("../assets/images/icon-star.svg");
  }
}
```

- In this code snippets the Empty string is represented the gap between the star-rating images.
